# MyMovies
MyMovies is a Compound Android app that uses the omdb api to allow a user to search for and favorite movies and preview their trailers and info.

# About the app
The app consists of a Login and a Sign Up page to get you started with an account for the MyMovie app in order to store your favorite movies and other user data.

On the main page of the app upon logging in, many options are presented to Search for a movie by Title, Author and Genre.

Once a movie is searched for, you will be presented with a list of movies found through your search. Upon choosing one you will be presented with all of the relevant information about that movie.

From here you can also mark it as a favorite, remove it from your favorites, or preview both the trailer and the movie poster.

# Dependencies
This project uses the Volley API to manage all REST related content. The OMDb API is used in conjunction with Volley to access a vast database of movies and their details.

# Purpose
The purpose of this project is for my Mobile App Project's Class Final Project and is meant to sum up everything learned throughout the course in a well thought out app.

This app was completed in pure native Android. All components of the app were designed using GIMP and Photoshop.
